 * MVC:

 * Controller:
 *   - Controlls the flow between views and models;
 *   - Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view;
 *   - Delegates everything (the view and the model are separated).
 *
 * View:
 *   - Everythings DOM (event listeners, renders/injects).
 *
 * Model:
 *   - Object representations;
 *   - Carries and manages data;
 *   - JSON requests/replies.
