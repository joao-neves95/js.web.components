# js.web.components

## Observations:

**All of this can and will change in the future.**

js.web only supports the main browsers (I.e.: Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari).<br>
js.web does not support Internet Explorer.

## Features Roadmap:
- [x] Implement component property rendering
- [ ] Implement for loop with component property rendering from an array
- [ ] Implement two-way data binding
- [ ] Implement for loop with component property rendering from an object
- [ ] Implement if statement
- [ ] Implement support for having sub-components (render components inside other components)

## Motivation:
My teacher told the class to make a project using HTML, CSS and JQuery.<br/>
I already had experience working with these technologies, so I've asked him if I could use Angular or other framework. He said no.<br/>
So, I decided to make my own framework.<br/>
It's inspired by Angular, React and even ASP.NET.<br/>
This is a work in progress.
